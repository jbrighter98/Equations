# Equations

Write your equations using MathTex Markup language in your designated python files.
https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/text/mathtext.html

write them in this format:

### variable = r'$z=\frac{x}{y^2}$'


which would look like

just make a bunch of variables, one on each line. 
Also if the formula has a name, write the name as a comment above the variable

If the formula doesn't have a name, make one.

a full example would be 

#Formula Name

variable = r'$z=\frac{x}{y^2}$'
